My name is Lovish Tater. I’m a software engineer, AI tinkerer, and startup builder. I’m originally from India and currently based in Pune. Over the years, I’ve helped build and scale tech at multiple early-stage startups—going from 0 to 1 and beyond across domains like edtech, social, e-commerce, and food tech.

I thrive in fast-moving environments, especially where product, speed, and systems matter more than titles. Outside of code, I’m diving deep into AI agents and exploring the path to entrepreneurship. Fun fact: I’m on a weight gain journey right now and chasing a 2700-calorie target every day—but I’ll still always make room for good coffee and street-style chaat.
